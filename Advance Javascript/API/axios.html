Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript, 
which is used to make HTTP requests to fetch or send data to a server. 

It simplifies the process of handling requests by providing a cleaner API, 
better error handling, and support for features like request/response interceptors, 
cancellation, and more. 

It is also fully compatible with modern browsers and can be used in both the 
browser and NodeJS environments.
